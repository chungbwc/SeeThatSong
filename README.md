# See That Song
 See that song is a piece of audio visualisation artwork to remember a piece of song/music that was once popular in Hong Kong and is now in a process of disappearance. The work recorded the daily exercises in June and July 2023 using [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) to visualise the music with various techniques, before the music will disappear in public domain. This repository maintains all the source TouchDesigner project files. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfW3ifLccmdQRThwol4GQRYyoaEjBbqVZ) also maintains all the abstract animations generated by the projects.
